                        Fresh off the release of its first full-length trailer, Netflix's live-action One Piece has dropped another unexpected sneak peek.
                        According to a report from verified One Piece news sourcethe series has registered the titles of its first eight episodes with the Writers Guild
                         of America, giving fans a preview of what to expect from the first season. Another news outlet previously leaked the adaptation's episode titles, 
                         and while some have proven accurate, it seems many were either speculation or changed by the series since initially reported. The pilot episode “Romance Dawn”
                          remains a constant, as does the pirate classic “Tell No Tales,” 
                        while the remaining changed titles present a vastly different portrait of what the first installment of this highly anticipated series has in store.
