                <p>The storyboard artist creates a visual representation of the script, consisting of rough sketches or drawings.
                    Each panel of the storyboard depicts a specific scene or shot, including camera angles and character movements.

                     make important decisions regarding composition, camera angles, pacing, and storytelling techniques.
                     Storyboards also indicate the timing and pacing of the story. Panels may include notes or arrows
                 to indicate the duration of a shot or transition between shots.Storyboards often include additional annotations 
                 or notes to provide further guidance and information to the production team.These notes may describe
                  character movements, camera movements, visual effects, or specific instructions for animators or editors.

                <h1>Animation Compositing</h1>
                <img src="prod7.jpg">
                <p>Animation compositing is the process of combining various visual elements, such as 2D or 3D animation, live-action footage, visual effects, and backgrounds, into a final image or sequence.
                 It is an integral part of the post-production stage in animation and is essential for creating a cohesive and visually appealing result.
                 Before compositing can begin, all the necessary assets are collected and prepared. This includes rendered animation sequences, visual effects elements, backgrounds, and any other relevant components
                 The different elements are organized and stacked in layers according to their intended order in the final composition. Each layer represents a specific element or visual component, such as characters, backgrounds, or effects.
                 The compositor then manipulates and transforms the layers as needed to achieve the desired visual result. This may involve adjusting the position, scale, rotation, or opacity of the layers.
                  It allows the compositor to create depth, perspective, and seamless integration between the elements.
                  To blend the layers together, the compositor utilizes blending modes and opacity settings. Blending modes determine how the pixels of one layer interact with the pixels of the layers below, 
                  resulting in various effects such as additive blending, screen blending, or multiply blending.
                  Once the compositing process is complete, the composition is rendered into a final image or sequence. This involves processing 
                  all the layers, effects, and adjustments to produce the desired output format, resolution, and quality.
                  Animation compositing requires a combination of technical skills and artistic sensibility. Compositors work closely with animators, visual effects artists, and directors to achieve the desired visual style and seamlessly integrate various elements into a cohesive final product.

                <p>During post-production, the anime undergoes a thorough review, editing, and refinement process. The editing team fine-tunes the pacing, transitions, and overall coherence of the anime. This stage involves ensuring continuity, eliminating errors, and enhancing the overall quality of the final product.
                    Post-production and editing are crucial stages in the filmmaking process that occur after the principal photography or animation is complete. These stages involve various tasks to shape and refine the raw footage or animation into a cohesive and polished final product
                    Post-production and editing require technical skills, creative decision-making, and a keen understanding of storytelling. The post-production team, including the editor, visual effects artists, sound designers, and colorists, work closely with the director or producer
                     to bring the vision of the film to life and ensure a polished and engaging final product.
